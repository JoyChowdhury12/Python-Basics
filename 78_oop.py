#to map with real life scenarios, we started using object orientes in code. This is called object oriented programming

# class Student : 
#     name = "Joy Chowdhury"


# # creating object(instance)

# s1 = Student()
# print(s1.name)


class Car :
    color = "Blue"
    brand = "Mercedes"

car1 = Car()
print(car1.color)
print(car1.brand)
