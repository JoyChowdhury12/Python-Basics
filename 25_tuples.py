# this is a built in that lets us create immutable sequence of values

tup = (2,3,1,4)
print(tup[1])

#as this is immutable so assignment is not possible 

# tup[3] = 5



# also for single element we have to add one comma "," which is compulsury 

tup1 = (1,)
print(tup1)


# in tuples we also use slicing

print(tup[1:3])
